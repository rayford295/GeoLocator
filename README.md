**Context:**  
*Symposium on Spatiotemporal Data Science – Pre-symposium Training Workshop*  
*Washington, DC · July 22, 2024*

## 🧠 Overview

With the growing use of large multimodal models (LMMs) like GPT-4, the potential for **geo-privacy breaches** through online image sharing has drastically increased. This project presents **GeoLocator**, a GPT-4-based multimodal model capable of **inferring precise geographic information from images and social media content**.

🛰️ **Goal**: Assess the risks of LMMs in revealing sensitive geographic information  
🔎 **Approach**: Image + text → inferred location  
🛡️ **Outcome**: Raise awareness and support ethical GeoAI practices

## 🤖 Interactive Demo: GeoLocator Custom GPT

To facilitate interactive exploration and qualitative analysis, we provide a publicly accessible Custom GPT implementation of GeoLocator:

🔗 GeoLocator (Custom GPT)
https://chatgpt.com/g/g-qxqvMb6YJ-geolocator

This interactive version allows users to:

Upload images and assess potential geo-privacy leakage

Perform image-based location inference using multimodal reasoning

Explore how visual cues (architecture, signage, vegetation, terrain) contribute to geographic disclosure

The Custom GPT serves as a human-in-the-loop extension of the GeoLocator framework, complementing the quantitative experiments reported in the paper.

Usage Notice:
This tool is intended for research, educational, and ethical analysis purposes only.
Any use in publications, benchmarks, or derivative systems should properly cite the original paper and repository.

## 🏛️ Conference Presentation (AAG 2024)

This work was **accepted for oral presentation** at the **2024 Annual Meeting of the American Association of Geographers (AAG 2024)**, as part of a specialized symposium on GeoAI and deep learning for geospatial research.
- **Symposium:** *Symposium on GeoAI and Deep Learning for Geospatial Research:  
  Human-centered Geospatial Data Science III*  
- **Presenter:** Yifan Yang, University of Southern California
- **Official AAG Link:** https://aag.secure-platform.com/aag2024/solicitations/57/sessiongallery/7825/application/32545

**Presentation Schedule:**
- **Date:** April 19, 2024  
- **Time:** 10:40 AM – 12:00 PM (UTC−10:00, Hawaii Time)  
- **Location:** Room 304B (Mānoa), Third Floor, Hawaiʻi Convention Center  

**Paper Title:**  
*GeoLocator: A Location-Integrated Large Multimodal Model for Inferring Geo-Privacy*

**Research focus:**
- Large multimodal models (LMMs) for geographic inference  
- Location-integrated GPT-4–based reasoning  
- Geo-privacy risks and inference from imagery and social media content  
- Open-source intelligence (OSINT) and spatial privacy implications  

This presentation represents an early exploration of **multimodal spatial reasoning and geo-privacy inference**, which later informed the author’s broader research agenda in **GeoAI, disaster perception, and interpretable multimodal geospatial intelligence**.
